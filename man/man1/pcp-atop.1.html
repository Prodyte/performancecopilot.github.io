                DESCRIPTION
               </h2>
               The program
               <b>
                pcp-atop
               </b>
               is an interactive monitor to view various aspects of load on a system.
              It shows the occupation of the most critical hardware resources 
              (from a performance point of view) on system level, i.e. cpu, memory, disk
              and network.
               <br/>
               It also shows which processes are responsible for the indicated
              load with respect to cpu and memory load on process level.
              Disk load is shown per process if "storage accounting" is active in the kernel.
               <p>
                Every
                <i>
                 interval
                </i>
                (default: 10 seconds) information is shown about the resource occupation
              on system level (cpu, memory, disks and network layers), followed
              by a list of processes which have been active during the last interval
              (note that all processes that were unchanged during the last interval
              are not shown, unless the key 'a' has been pressed).
              If the list of active processes does not entirely fit on
              the screen, only the top of the list is shown (sorted in order of activity).
                <br/>
                The intervals are repeated till the number of
                <i>
                 samples
                </i>
                (specified as command argument) is reached, or till the key 'q' is pressed
              in interactive mode.

               <p>
                When
                <b>
                 pcp-atop
                </b>
                is started, it checks whether the standard output channel is connected to a
              screen, or to a file/pipe. In the first case it produces screen control 
              codes (via the ncurses library) and behaves interactively; in the second case
              it produces flat ASCII-output.
               </p>
               <p>
                In interactive mode, the output of
                <b>
                 pcp-atop
                </b>
                scales dynamically to the current dimensions of the screen/window.
                <br/>
                If the window is resized horizontally, columns will be added or removed
              automatically. For this purpose, every column has a particular weight. The
              columns with the highest weights that fit within the current width will
              be shown.
                <br/>
                If the window is resized vertically, lines of the process/thread list 
              will be added or removed automatically.
               </p>
               <p>
                Furthermore in interactive mode the output of
                <b>
                 pcp-atop
                </b>
                can be controlled by pressing particular keys.
              However it is also possible to specify such key as
                <b>
                 flag
                </b>
                on the command line. In that case
                <b>
                 pcp-atop
                </b>
                switches to the indicated mode on beforehand; this mode can 
              be modified again interactively. Specifying such key as flag is especially
              useful when running
                <b>
                 pcp-atop
                </b>
                with output to a pipe or file (non-interactively).
              These flags are the same as the keys that can be pressed in interactive
              mode (see section INTERACTIVE COMMANDS).
                <br/>
                Additional flags are available to support storage of
                <b>
                 pcp-atop
                </b>
                data in PCP archive format (see section PCP DATA STORAGE).

                COLORS
               </h2>
               For the resource consumption on system level,
               <b>
                pcp-atop
               </b>
               uses colors to indicate that a critical occupation percentage has
              been (almost) reached. 
              A critical occupation percentage means that is likely that this load
              causes a noticeable negative performance influence for applications using
              this resource. The critical percentage depends on the type of resource:
              e.g. the performance influence of a disk with a busy percentage of 80%
              might be more noticeable for applications/user than a CPU with a busy
              percentage of 90%.
               <br/>
               Currently
               <b>
                pcp-atop
               </b>
               uses the following default values to calculate a weighted percentage
              per resource:
               <p>
               </p>
               <dl compact="">

                <dd>
                 A busy percentage of 90% or higher is considered `critical'.

                <dd>
                 A busy percentage of 70% or higher is considered `critical'.

                 A busy percentage of 90% or higher for the load of an interface is
              considered `critical'.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                 <b>

                <dd>
                 An occupation percentage of 90% is considered `critical'.
              Notice that this occupation percentage is the accumulated memory
              consumption of the kernel (including slab) and all processes; the
              memory for the page cache (`cache' and `buff' in the MEM-line) and the
              reclaimable part of the slab (`slrec`) is not implied!
                 <br/>
                 If the number of pages swapped out (`swout' in the PAG-line) is larger
              than 10 per second, the memory resource is considered `critical'.
              A value of at least 1 per second is considered `almost critical'.
                 <br/>
                 If the committed virtual memory exceeds the limit (`vmcom' and `vmlim'
              in the SWP-line), the SWP-line is colored due to overcommitting the system.
                </dd>

                </dt>
                <dd>
                 An occupation percentage of 80% is considered `critical'
              because swap space might be completely exhausted in the near future;
              it is not critical from a performance point-of-view.
                </dd>
               </dl>
               <p>
                These default values can be modified in the configuration file
              (see separate man-page of pcp-atoprc).
               </p>
               <p>
                When a resource exceeds its critical occupation percentage, the concerning
              values in the screen line are colored red by default.

                When a resource exceeded (default) 80% of its critical percentage
              (so it is almost critical), the concerning values in the screen line
              are colored cyan by default. This `almost critical percentage' (one value
              for all resources) can be modified in the configuration file
              (see separate man-page of pcp-atoprc).
                <br/>
                The default colors red and cyan can be modified in the configuration file

                OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
               </h2>
               The first sample shows the system level activity since boot
              (the elapsed time in the header shows the time since boot).
              Note that particular counters could have reached their maximum
              value (several times) and started by zero again,
              so do not rely on these figures.
               <p>
                For every sample
                <b>
                 pcp-atop
                </b>
                first shows the lines related to system level activity. If a particular 
              system resource has not been used during the interval, the entire line
              related to this resource is suppressed. So the number of system level lines
              may vary for each sample.
                <br/>
                After that a list is shown of processes which have been active during the last
              interval. This list is by default sorted on cpu consumption, but this order
              can be changed by the keys which are previously described.
               </p>
               <p>
                If values have to be shown by
                <b>
                 pcp-atop
                </b>
                which do not fit in the column width,
              another format is used. If e.g. a cpu-consumption of 233216 milliseconds
              should be shown in a column width of 4 positions, it is shown as `233s'
              (in seconds).
              For large memory figures, another unit is chosen if the value does not fit
              (Mb instead of Kb, Gb instead of Mb, Tb instead of Gb, ...).
              For other values, a kind of exponent notation is used (value 123456789
              shown in a column of 5 positions gives 123e6).

                  Every line contains the percentage of cpu time spent in 
              kernel mode by all active processes (`sys'), 
              the percentage of cpu time consumed in user mode (`user') for all
              active processes (including processes running with a nice value larger than
              zero), the percentage of cpu time spent for interrupt handling (`irq')
              including softirq, the percentage of unused cpu time while no processes

                  In case of frequency-scaling, all previously mentioned CPU-percentages

              If a CPU has been active for e.g. 50% in user mode during the interval

                 The proportional memory size of this process (or user).
                 <br/>
                 Every process shares resident memory with other processes. E.g. when a
              particular program is started several times, the code pages (text) are
              only loaded once in memory and shared by all incarnations. Also the code
              of shared libraries is shared by all processes using that shared library,
              as well as shared memory and memory-mapped files.
              For the PSIZE calculation of a process, the resident memory of a process
              that is shared with other processes is divided by the number of sharers.
              This means, that every process is accounted for a proportional part of
              that memory. Accumulating the PSIZE values of all processes in the
              system gives a reliable impression of the total resident memory consumed
              by all processes.
                 <br/>
                 Since gathering of all values that are needed to calculate the PSIZE is a
              relatively time-consuming task, the 'R' key (or '-R' flag) should
              be active. Gathering these values also requires superuser privileges
              (otherwise '?K' is shown in the output).

                 <br/>
                 Unfortunately, the kernel aggregates the
              data tranfer of a process to the data transfer of its parent process when
              terminating, so you might see transfers for (parent) processes like
              cron, bash or init, that are not really issued by them.

                 The amount of resident memory that the process has grown during the last

              were not physically created/loaded before (load-on-demand). 
              Note that a resident growth can also be negative e.g. when part of the process
              is paged out due to lack of memory or when the process frees dynamically 
              allocated memory.
              For a process which started during the last interval, the resident growth
              reflects the total resident size of the process at that moment.
