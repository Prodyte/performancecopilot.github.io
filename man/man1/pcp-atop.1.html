 <h2>
  DESCRIPTION
 </h2>
 The program
 <b>
  pcp-atop
 </b>
 is an interactive monitor to view various aspects of load on a system.
It shows the occupation of the most critical hardware resources
(from a performance point of view) on system level, i.e. cpu, memory, disk
and network.
 <br/>
 It also shows which processes are responsible for the indicated
load with respect to cpu and memory load on process level.
Disk load is shown per process if "storage accounting" is active
in the kernel.
 <p>
  Every
  <i>
   interval
  </i>
  (default: 10 seconds) information is shown about the resource occupation
on system level (cpu, memory, disks and network layers), followed
by a list of processes which have been active during the last interval
(note that all processes that were unchanged during the last interval
are not shown, unless the key 'a' has been pressed or unless sorting on
memory occupation is done).
If the list of active processes does not entirely fit on
the screen, only the top of the list is shown (sorted in order of activity).
  <br/>
  The intervals are repeated till the number of
  <i>
   samples
  </i>
  (specified as command argument) is reached, or till the key 'q' is pressed
in interactive mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  When invoked via the
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pcp.1.html">
    pcp
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

command, the
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pcpintro.1.html">

   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

options
  <b>
   -h
  </b>
  /
  <b>
   --host
  </b>
  ,
  <b>
   -a
  </b>
  /
  <b>

  <b>
   -Z
  </b>
  /
  <b>
   --timezone
  </b>
  and several other
  <i>
   pcp options
  </i>
  become indirectly available.
The long option form of these is directly available.
Additionally, the
  <b>
   --hotproc
  </b>
  option can be used to request the per-process PCP metrics be used instead
of the default proc metrics from
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmdaproc.1.html">
    pmdaproc
   </a>
  </b>
  (1).
 </p>
 <p>
  When
  <b>
   pcp-atop
  </b>
  is started, it checks whether the standard output channel is connected to a
screen, or to a file/pipe.
In the first case it produces screen control
codes (via the ncurses library) and behaves interactively;
in the second case it produces flat ASCII-output.
 </p>
 <p>
  In interactive mode, the output of
  <b>
   pcp-atop
  </b>
  scales dynamically to the current dimensions of the screen/window.
  <br/>
  If the window is resized horizontally, columns will be added or removed
automatically. For this purpose, every column has a particular weight.
The columns with the highest weights that fit within the current width will
be shown.
  <br/>
  If the window is resized vertically, lines of the process/thread list
will be added or removed automatically.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore in interactive mode the output of
  <b>
   pcp-atop
  </b>
  can be controlled by pressing particular keys.
However it is also possible to specify such key as
  <b>
   flag
  </b>
  on the command line.
In that case
  <b>
   pcp-atop
  </b>
  switches to the indicated mode on beforehand; this mode can
be modified again interactively.
Specifying such key as flag is especially useful when running
  <b>
   pcp-atop
  </b>
  with output to a pipe or file (non-interactively).
These flags are the same as the keys that can be pressed in interactive
mode (see section INTERACTIVE COMMANDS).
  <br/>
  Additional flags are available to support storage of
  <b>
   pcp-atop
  </b>
  data in PCP archive format (see section PCP DATA STORAGE).

 <h2>
  COLORS
 </h2>
 For the resource consumption on system level,
 <b>
  pcp-atop
 </b>
 uses colors to indicate that a critical occupation percentage has
been (almost) reached.
A critical occupation percentage means that is likely that this load
causes a noticeable negative performance influence for applications using
this resource.
The critical percentage depends on the type of resource:
e.g. the performance influence of a disk with a busy percentage of 80%
might be more noticeable for applications/user than a CPU with a busy
percentage of 90%.
 <br/>
 Currently
 <b>
  pcp-atop
 </b>
 uses the following default values to calculate a weighted percentage
per resource:
 <dl compact="">
  <dt>
   <b>
    Processor
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   A busy percentage of 90% or higher is considered `critical'.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    Disk
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   A busy percentage of 70% or higher is considered `critical'.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    Network
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   A busy percentage of 90% or higher for the load of an interface is
considered `critical'.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    Memory
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   An occupation percentage of 90% is considered `critical'.
Notice that this occupation percentage is the accumulated memory
consumption of the kernel (including slab) and all processes; the
memory for the page cache (`cache' and `buff' in the MEM-line) and the
reclaimable part of the slab (`slrec`) is not implied!
   <br/>
   If the number of pages swapped out (`swout' in the PAG-line) is larger
than 10 per second, the memory resource is considered `critical'.
A value of at least 1 per second is considered `almost critical'.
   <br/>
   If the committed virtual memory exceeds the limit (`vmcom' and `vmlim'
in the SWP-line), the SWP-line is colored due to overcommitting the system.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    Swap
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   An occupation percentage of 80% is considered `critical'
because swap space might be completely exhausted in the near future;
it is not critical from a performance point-of-view.
  </dd>
 </dl>
 <p>
  These default values can be modified in the configuration file
(see separate man-page of
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man5/pcp-atoprc.5.html">
    pcp-atoprc
   </a>
  </b>
  (5)).
 </p>
 <p>
  When a resource exceeds its critical occupation percentage, the concerning
values in the screen line are colored red by default.
  <br/>
  When a resource exceeded (default) 80% of its critical percentage
(so it is almost critical), the concerning values in the screen line
are colored cyan by default.
This `almost critical percentage' (one value
for all resources) can be modified in the configuration file
(see separate man-page of
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man5/pcp-atoprc.5.html">
    pcp-atoprc
   </a>
  </b>
  (5)).
  <br/>
  The default colors red and cyan can be modified in the configuration file
as well (see separate man-page of
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man5/pcp-atoprc.5.html">
    pcp-atoprc
   </a>
  </b>
  (5)).
 </p>
 <p>
  With the key 'x' (or flag
  <b>
   -x
  </b>
  ), the use of colors can be suppressed.

 <h2>
  GPU STATISTICS GATHERING
 </h2>
 GPU statistics can be gathered by
 <b>
  <a href="/man/man1/pmdanvidia.1.html">
   pmdanvidia
  </a>
 </b>
 (1)

which is a separate data collection daemon process.
It gathers cumulative utilization counters of every Nvidia GPU
in the system, as well as utilization counters of every
process that uses a GPU.
When
 <b>
  pcp-atop
 </b>
 notices that the daemon is active, it reads these GPU utilization
counters with every interval.
 <p>
  Find a description about the utilization counters in the section OUTPUT DESCRIPTION.

 </p>
 <h2>
  INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
 </h2>
 When running
 <b>
  pcp-atop
 </b>
 interactively (no output redirection), keys can be pressed to control the
output.
In general, lower case keys can be used to show other information for
the active processes and upper case keys can be used to influence the
sort order of the active process/thread list.
 <dl compact="">
  <dt>
   <b>
    g
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Show generic output (default).
   <p>
    Per process the following fields are shown in case of a window-width
of 80 positions:
process-id, cpu consumption during
the last interval in system and user mode, the virtual and resident
memory growth of the process.
   </p>
   <p>
    The subsequent columns depend on the used kernel:
    <br/>
    When the kernel supports "storage accounting" (&gt;= 2.6.20), the data
transfer for read/write on disk, the status and exit code are
shown for each process.
When the kernel does not support
"storage accounting", the username, number of threads in the
thread group, the status and exit code are shown.
    <br/>
    The last columns contain the state, the occupation percentage for the
chosen resource (default: cpu) and the process name.
   </p>
   <p>
    When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.
   </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    m
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Show memory related output.
   <p>
    Per process the following fields are shown in case of a window-width
of 80 positions:
process-id, minor and major
memory faults, size of virtual shared text, total virtual
process size, total resident process size, virtual and resident growth during
last interval, memory occupation percentage and process name.
   </p>
   <p>
    When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.
   </p>
   <p>
    For memory consumption, always all processes are shown (also the processes
that were not active during the interval).
   </p>
  </dd>

amount of data that was written but has been withdrawn again (WCANCL),
disk occupation percentage and process name.
   </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    s
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Show scheduling characteristics.
   <p>
    Per process the following fields are shown in case of a window-width
of 80 positions:
process-id,
number of threads in state 'running' (R),
number of threads in state 'interruptible sleeping' (S),
number of threads in state 'uninterruptible sleeping' (D),
scheduling policy (normal timesharing, realtime round-robin, realtime fifo),
nice value, priority, realtime priority, current processor,
status, exit code, state, the occupation percentage for the chosen
resource and the process name.
   </p>
   <p>
    When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.
   </p>
  </dd>

   <p>
    Per process the following fields are shown in case of a window-width
of 80 positions:
process-id, user name and group,
start date and time, status (e.g. exit code if the process has finished),
state, the occupation percentage for the chosen resource and the process name.
   </p>
   <p>
    When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.
   </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    c
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Show the command line of the process.
   <p>
    Per process the following fields are shown: process-id,
the occupation percentage for the chosen resource and the
command line including arguments.
   </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    e
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Show GPU utilization.
   <p>
    Per process at least the following fields are shown:
process-id,
range of GPU numbers on which the process currently runs,
GPU busy percentage on all GPUs,
memory busy percentage (i.e. read and write accesses on memory) on all GPUs,
memory occupation at the moment of the sample,
average memory occupation during the sample, and
GPU percentage.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the
    <b>
     pmdanvidia
    </b>
    daemon does not run with root privileges, the GPU busy percentage and
the memory busy percentage are not available on process level.
In that case, the GPU percentage on process level reflects the
GPU memory occupation instead of the GPU busy percentage (which
is preferred).
   </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>

    For multi-threaded processes, one line represents the process
while additional lines show the activity
per individual thread (in a different color).
Depending on the option 'a' (all or active toggle), all threads are shown
or only the threads that were active during the last interval.
    <br/>
    Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.
   </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>

    Per user the following fields are shown: number of processes active
or terminated during last interval (or in total if combined with command `a'),
accumulated cpu consumption during last interval in system and user mode,
the current virtual and resident memory space consumed by active processes
(or all processes of the user if combined with command `a').
    <br/>
    When "storage accounting" is active in the kernel,
the accumulated read and write throughput on disk is shown.
When the kernel module `netatop' has been installed,
the number of received and sent network packets are shown.

    Per program the following fields are shown: number of processes active
or terminated during last interval (or in total if combined with command `a'),
accumulated cpu consumption during last interval in system and user mode,
the current virtual and resident memory space consumed by active processes
(or all processes of the user if combined with command `a').
    <br/>
    When "storage accounting" is active in the kernel,
the accumulated read and write throughput on disk is shown.

    Per container the following fields are shown: number of processes active
or terminated during last interval (or in total if combined with command `a'),
accumulated cpu consumption during last interval in system and user mode,
the current virtual and resident memory space consumed by active processes
(or all processes of the user if combined with command `a').
    <br/>
    When "storage accounting" is active in the kernel,
the accumulated read and write throughput on disk is shown.
    <br/>
    The last columns contain the accumulated occupation percentage for the
chosen resource (default: cpu) and the Docker container id (CID).

The one-but-last column changes to ``CPU''.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    E
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Sort the current list in the order of GPU utilization
(preferred, but only applicable
when the
   <b>
    pmdanvidia
   </b>
   daemon runs under root privileges) or the order of
GPU memory occupation).
The one-but-last column changes to ``GPU''.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    M

The most busy resource is determined by comparing the weighted
busy-percentages of the system resources, as described earlier in
the section COLORS.
   <br/>
   This option remains valid until
another sorting-order is explicitly selected again.
   <br/>
   A sorting-order for disk is only possible when "storage accounting" is active.

  </dt>
  <dd>
   Trigger a new sample manually.
This key can be pressed if the current sample
should be finished before the timer has exceeded,
or if no timer is set at all (interval timer defined as 0).
In the latter case
   <b>
    pcp-atop
   </b>
   can be used as a stopwatch to measure the load being caused by a
particular application transaction, without knowing on beforehand how many
seconds this transaction will last.

 <h2>
  PCP DATA STORAGE
 </h2>
 In order to store system and process level statistics for long-term
analysis (e.g. to check the system load and the active processes running
yesterday between 3:00 and 4:00 PM),
 <b>
  pcp-atop
 </b>
 can store the system and process level statistics in the PCP archive format,
as an archive folio (see
 <b>
  <a href="/man/man1/mkaf.1.html">
   mkaf
  </a>
 </b>
 (1)).
 <br/>
 All information about processes and threads is stored in the archive.
 <br/>
 The interval (default: 10 seconds) and number of samples (default: infinite)
can be passed as last arguments.
Instead of the number of samples, the flag
 <b>
  -S
 </b>
 can be used to indicate that
 <b>
  pcp-atop
 </b>
 should finish anyhow before midnight.
 <p>
  A PCP archive can be read and visualized again with the
  <b>
   -r
  </b>
  option.
The argument is a comma-separated list of names, each
of which may be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory containing
one or more archives.
If no argument is specified, the file
  <b>
   $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/HOST/YYYYMMDD
  </b>
  is opened for input (where
  <i>
   YYYYMMDD
  </i>
  are digits representing the current date, and HOST is the hostname of the
machine being logged).
If a filename is specified in the format YYYYMMDD (representing any valid
date), the file
  <b>
   $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/HOST/YYYYMMDD
  </b>
  is opened.
If a filename with the symbolic name
  <b>
   y
  </b>
  is specified, yesterday's daily logfile is opened
(this can be repeated so 'yyyy' indicates the logfile of four days ago).
  <br/>
  The samples from the file can be viewed interactively by using the key 't'
to show the next sample, the key 'T' to show the previous sample, the
key 'b' to branch to a particular time or the key 'r' to rewind to
the begin of the file.
  <br/>
  When output is redirected to a file or pipe,
  <b>
   pcp-atop
  </b>
  prints all samples in plain ASCII.
The default line length is 80 characters
in that case; with the flag
  <b>
   -L
  </b>
  followed by an alternate line length, more (or less) columns will be shown.
  <br/>
  With the flag
  <b>
   -b
  </b>
  (begin time) and/or
  <b>
   -e
  </b>
  (end time) followed by a time argument of the form HH:MM,
a certain time period within the archive can be selected.
  <a name="lbAI">

 </p>
 <h2>
  OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
 </h2>
 The first sample shows the system level activity since boot
(the elapsed time in the header shows the time since boot).
Note that particular counters could have reached their maximum
value (several times) and started by zero again,
so do not rely on these figures.
 <p>
  For every sample
  <b>
   pcp-atop
  </b>
  first shows the lines related to system level activity. If a particular
system resource has not been used during the interval, the entire line
related to this resource is suppressed.
So the number of system level lines may vary for each sample.
  <br/>
  After that a list is shown of processes which have been active
during the last
interval.
This list is by default sorted on cpu consumption, but this order
can be changed by the keys which are previously described.
 </p>
 <p>
  If values have to be shown by
  <b>
   pcp-atop
  </b>
  which do not fit in the column width,
another format is used. If e.g. a cpu-consumption of 233216 milliseconds
should be shown in a column width of 4 positions, it is shown as `233s'
(in seconds).
For large memory figures, another unit is chosen if the value does not fit
(Mb instead of Kb, Gb instead of Mb, Tb instead of Gb, ...).
For other values, a kind of exponent notation is used (value 123456789
shown in a column of 5 positions gives 123e6).

 <h2>
  OUTPUT DESCRIPTION - SYSTEM LEVEL
 </h2>
 The system level information consists of the following output lines:
 <dl compact="">
  <dt>
   <b>
    PRC
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Process and thread level totals.
   <br/>
   This line contains the total cpu time consumed
in system mode (`sys') and in user mode (`user'),
the total number of processes present at this moment (`#proc'),
the total number of threads present at this moment in state `running' (`#trun'),
`sleeping interruptible' (`#tslpi') and `sleeping uninterruptible' (`#tslpu'),
the number of zombie processes (`#zombie'),
the number of clone system calls (`clones'), and
the number of processes that ended during the interval
(`#exit') when process accounting is used. Instead of `#exit` the last
column may indicate that process accounting could not be activated
(`no procacct`).
   <br/>
   If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters,
only a relevant subset is shown.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    CPU
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   CPU utilization.
   <br/>
   At least one line is shown for the total occupation of all CPUs together.
   <br/>
   In case of a multi-processor system, an additional line is shown
for every individual processor (with `cpu' in lower case),
sorted on activity.
Inactive CPUs will not be shown by default.
The lines showing the per-cpu occupation contain the cpu number in
the field combined with the wait percentage.
   <p>
    Every line contains the percentage of cpu time spent in
kernel mode by all active processes (`sys'),
the percentage of cpu time consumed in user mode (`user') for all
active processes (including processes running with a nice value larger than
zero), the percentage of cpu time spent for interrupt handling (`irq')
including softirq, the percentage of unused cpu time while no processes
were waiting for disk I/O (`idle'), and
the percentage of unused cpu time while at least one process was waiting
for disk I/O (`wait').
    <br/>
    In case of per-cpu occupation, the cpu number and
the wait percentage (`w') for that cpu.
The number of lines showing the per-cpu occupation can be limited.
   </p>
   <p>
    For virtual machines, the steal-percentage (`steal') shows
the percentage of cpu time stolen by other virtual machines
running on the same hardware.
    <br/>
    For physical machines hosting one or more virtual machines,
the guest-percentage (`guest') shows
the percentage of cpu time used by the virtual machines.
Notice that this percentage overlaps the user-percentage!
   </p>
   <p>
    When PMC performance monitoring counters are supported by the CPU
and the kernel (and
    <b>
     <a href="/man/man1/pmdaperfevent.1.html">
      pmdaperfevent
     </a>
    </b>
    (1)

runs with root privileges), the number of instructions per
CPU cycle (`ipc') is shown.
The first sample always shows the value 'initial',
because the counters are just activated at the moment that
    <b>
     pcp-atop
    </b>
    is started.
    <br/>
    When the
    <i>
     CPU busy percentage is high
    </i>
    and the IPC is less than 1.0,
it is likely that the CPU is frequently waiting for memory access
during instruction execution (larger CPU caches or faster memory might
be helpful to improve performance).
When the
    <i>
     CPU busy percentage is high
    </i>
    and the IPC is greater than 1.0,
it is likely that the CPU is instruction-bound (more/faster cores
might be helpful to improve performance).
    <br/>
    Furthermore, per CPU the effective number of cycles (`cycl') is shown.
This value can reach the current CPU frequency if such CPU is 100% busy.
When an idle CPU is halted, the number of effective cycles can
be (considerably) lower than the current frequency.
    <br/>
    Notice that the
    <i>
     average
    </i>
    instructions per cycle and number of cycles is shown in the CPU line
for all CPUs.
    <br/>

   </p>
   <p>
    In case of frequency scaling, all previously mentioned CPU percentages
are relative to the used scaling of the CPU during the interval.
If a CPU has been active for e.g. 50% in user mode during the interval
while the frequency scaling of that CPU was 40%, only 20% of the full
capacity of the CPU has been used in user mode.

  </dt>
  <dd>
   The policies 'norm' (normal, which is SCHED_OTHER), 'btch' (batch)

timesharing processes (variable priority depending on their recent

  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    PSIZE
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   The proportional memory size of this process (or user).
   <br/>
   Every process shares resident memory with other processes.
E.g. when a
particular program is started several times, the code pages (text) are
only loaded once in memory and shared by all incarnations.
Also the code
of shared libraries is shared by all processes using that shared library,
as well as shared memory and memory-mapped files.
For the PSIZE calculation of a process, the resident memory of a process
that is shared with other processes is divided by the number of sharers.
This means, that every process is accounted for a proportional part of
that memory.
Accumulating the PSIZE values of all processes in the
system gives a reliable impression of the total resident memory consumed
by all processes.
   <br/>
   Since gathering of all values that are needed to calculate the PSIZE is a
relatively time-consuming task, the 'R' key (or '-R' flag) should
be active.
Gathering these values also requires superuser privileges
(otherwise '?K' is shown in the output).

  SIGNALS
 </h2>
 By sending the SIGUSR1 signal to
 <b>
  pcp-atop
 </b>
 a new sample will be forced, even if the current timer interval
has not exceeded yet.
The behavior is similar to pressing the `t` key
in an interactive session.
 <p>
  By sending the SIGUSR2 signal to
  <b>
   pcp-atop
  </b>
  a final sample will be forced after which
  <b>
   pcp-atop
  </b>
  will terminate.
